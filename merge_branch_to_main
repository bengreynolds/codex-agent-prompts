The primary goal of this session is to prepare for a clean and intentional merge of the current branch into main.

To achieve this, the agent should:

Identify which files differ between the current branch and main.

For each differing file, identify the specific lines or code regions that have changed.

Determine whether each difference represents:

New functionality

Modified behavior

Refactoring without behavior change

Bug fixes or regressions

Constraints & Priorities

Preserve all intended functionality and behavior of the current branch.

Do not assume that main is correct by default; evaluate conflicts based on behavior and intent.

Avoid making code changes until a clear merge plan is documented in planning.md.

Prefer minimal, explicit changes that reduce merge risk.

Expected Outcome

By the end of the session:

planning.md contains a clear, file-by-file and line-level summary of differences versus main.

The document includes a proposed merge strategy explaining how to incorporate the current branch into main while maintaining or improving existing behavior.

No functional code edits are performed without being justified by the documented plan.

Wait for explicit instruction to utilize the current plan to proceed in functional code edits
