# Branch Setup

## Purpose
Initialize a working branch session and create local planning artifacts.

## Steps
1. Create a `.gitignore` entry that prevents all `.md` files from being committed.
2. Commit that `.gitignore` change to the current working branch.
3. Create two local (not committed) markdown files:
   - `agent.md` to capture assumptions, constraints, and decision-making principles.
   - `planning.md` to capture the merge strategy, findings, and step-by-step plan.

## Notes
- The local files should be referenced throughout the session before making any editing or refactoring decisions.
