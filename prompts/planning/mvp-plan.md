# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Plan

## Purpose
Define the smallest, explicit set of functionality needed to satisfy a stated task, while controlling scope, risk, and time-to-value.

## Inputs
- Explicit task statement and desired outcome.
- Target users or stakeholders.
- Constraints (time, budget, compliance, security, risk tolerance).
- Existing system context (if any).

## Constraints
- The MVP must be deliverable with minimal scope and risk.
- Features outside the stated goal are out of scope unless approved.
- Define what is explicitly not included.
- If the task statement is unclear, ask for clarification before planning.

## Steps
1. Clarify the task
   - Restate the goal and desired outcome.
   - Confirm the target user and the core user need.
2. Define success criteria
   - Identify measurable signals of success.
   - Specify minimum acceptance criteria.
3. Identify must-have capabilities
   - List the smallest set of features required to meet the goal.
   - Separate "must-have" from "nice-to-have."
4. Define exclusions
   - Explicitly list what will not be built in the MVP.
5. Outline the delivery plan
   - Sequence the work into the smallest feasible milestones.
   - Note dependencies and risks.
6. Validation plan
   - Define how the MVP will be tested and validated.
   - Identify the feedback loop for iteration.

## Output format
- Task summary and target user.
- MVP scope (must-haves).
- Out-of-scope list.
- Acceptance criteria and success metrics.
- Delivery plan with milestones.
- Risks and validation plan.

## Completion criteria
- The MVP scope is minimal, explicit, and aligned to the task.
- Success criteria and exclusions are documented.
- The plan is actionable without additional assumptions.
