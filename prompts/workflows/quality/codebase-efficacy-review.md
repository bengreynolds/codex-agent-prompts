# Codebase Efficacy Review

## Purpose
Evaluate the overall efficacy of a codebase by identifying opportunities for improvement, optimization, and maintenance without proposing changes that are out of scope.

## Inputs
- Target scope (entire repo or specific modules).
- Performance, reliability, or quality goals.
- Known pain points and constraints.

## Constraints
- Recommendations must be evidence-based and scoped.
- Avoid speculative rewrites or large refactors without justification.
- If data is missing, request it before concluding.

## Steps
1. Establish evaluation goals
   - Define what "effective" means for this project.
   - Identify key metrics (performance, reliability, cost, maintainability).
2. Scan for signals
   - Review architecture, module boundaries, and dependency health.
   - Identify hot paths, error-prone areas, and test coverage gaps.
3. Identify improvements
   - List potential optimizations and maintenance actions.
   - Rank by impact, risk, and effort.
4. Validate feasibility
   - Note dependencies, blockers, and required approvals.
   - Propose quick wins vs long-term changes.
5. Summarize findings
   - Provide a concise report with recommendations and next steps.

## Output format
- Evaluation goals and scope.
- Findings grouped by category.
- Ranked recommendations with rationale.
- Risks and prerequisites.

## Completion criteria
- Findings are evidence-based and actionable.
- Recommendations are prioritized and scoped.
- Open questions are documented.
