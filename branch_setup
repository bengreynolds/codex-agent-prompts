Create a .gitignore that prevents all .md files from being committed.

Commit this change to the current working branch.

Create two markdown files (locally, not committed):

agent.md: to capture agent assumptions, constraints, and decision-making principles.

planning.md: to capture the merge strategy, findings, and step-by-step plan.
These files should be referenced throughout the session before making any editing or refactoring decisions.
